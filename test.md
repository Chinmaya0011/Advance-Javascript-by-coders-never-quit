# üóìÔ∏è 10-Day JavaScript, React & Node.js Practice Roadmap

This roadmap is designed to take you from **Intermediate ‚Üí Advanced** JavaScript concepts with a focus on **React** and **Node.js**. Each day includes **topics to study** + **practice exercises** + **mini-project ideas**.

---

## **Day 1: Advanced Functions & Closures**

### Topics:
- Closures (encapsulation, caching, private data)
- Higher-Order Functions (map, filter, reduce, custom HOFs)
- Currying & Partial Application
- Function Composition

### Exercises:
- Implement a caching function using closures.
- Create a `compose` function for function composition.
- Write a curried function for multiplication.

### Mini Project:
- Build a small utility library with functions like `compose`, `curry`, and `memoize`.

---

## **Day 2: Scope, Hoisting & `this`**

### Topics:
- Execution Context & Lexical Scope
- Hoisting (variables & functions)
- `this` binding: default, implicit, explicit (`call`, `apply`, `bind`)
- Arrow functions vs normal functions in React components

### Exercises:
- Experiment with `this` in different function types.
- Predict output for nested function calls with variable hoisting.
- Convert a normal React function component to use arrow functions and observe `this` behavior.

### Mini Project:
- Create a React component with event handlers showcasing proper `this` usage.

---

## **Day 3: Objects, Prototypes & ES6 Classes**

### Topics:
- Prototype Chain & Inheritance
- `Object.create`, `__proto__` vs `.prototype`
- ES6 Classes, static methods, `extends`
- Custom object inheritance in Node.js utilities

### Exercises:
- Create a class hierarchy for shapes (Circle, Rectangle) with inherited methods.
- Implement a custom prototype chain example.
- Use `Object.create` to clone objects with a shared prototype.

### Mini Project:
- Node.js utility library with class-based data models.

---

## **Day 4: Advanced Array & Object Operations**

### Topics:
- Destructuring & Rest/Spread operator
- Immutable patterns (React state)
- Deep cloning vs shallow cloning
- Performance tricks with large arrays

### Exercises:
- Write functions to deep clone nested objects.
- Implement array transformation pipelines with map/filter/reduce.
- Practice immutable updates for React state.

### Mini Project:
- Todo app backend in Node.js emphasizing immutable updates.

---

## **Day 5: Event Loop, Concurrency & Async JS**

### Topics:
- Event Loop: Call Stack, Task Queue, Microtasks
- `setTimeout`, `setImmediate`, `process.nextTick`
- Async execution order with Promises and async/await
- Sequential vs parallel async execution, Promise pooling

### Exercises:
- Predict console output with nested async functions.
- Implement a Promise pool to limit concurrent requests.
- Convert a callback-based function to async/await.

### Mini Project:
- Fetch multiple APIs concurrently with limited concurrency.

---

## **Day 6: Modules, Imports & Advanced ES6+ Features**

### Topics:
- CommonJS vs ES Modules
- Dynamic imports (React lazy loading)
- Tree shaking & code splitting
- Symbols, Iterators, Generators, Proxy, Reflect, Tagged template literals

### Exercises:
- Create a generator to yield Fibonacci numbers.
- Use `Proxy` to log all property accesses.
- Practice dynamic import in a React component.

### Mini Project:
- Build a React dashboard with lazy-loaded widgets.

---

## **Day 7: Memory, Optimization & Design Patterns**

### Topics:
- Garbage collection basics
- Memory leaks in Node.js & React
- WeakMap, WeakSet
- Debouncing, Throttling, Memoization
- Module, Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy patterns

### Exercises:
- Implement debounce and throttle utilities.
- Create a simple Observer pattern example.
- Use `WeakMap` to store private object data.

### Mini Project:
- React search input with debounced API calls.

---

## **Day 8: React Advanced Concepts**

### Topics:
- State updates are async
- Closures in hooks
- Custom hooks using closures & HOFs
- Context API & avoiding prop drilling
- Suspense & Concurrent Mode basics

### Exercises:
- Create a custom hook for form handling.
- Implement a context provider with state updates.
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` for performance optimization.

### Mini Project:
- Multi-component React app using Context for global state.

---

## **Day 9: Node.js Advanced Concepts**

### Topics:
- EventEmitter & Pub/Sub pattern
- Streams & Buffers
- Async Iterators with `for await...of`
- Cluster & Worker Threads
- Global error handling (`uncaughtException`, `unhandledRejection`)

### Exercises:
- Implement an EventEmitter-based chat system.
- Stream a large file line by line.
- Use Worker Threads for CPU-intensive tasks.

### Mini Project:
- CLI file processing tool using streams and async iterators.

---

## **Day 10: Security, Testing & Real-World Patterns**

### Topics:
- Prototype pollution prevention
- JWT, OAuth2, session handling
- Role-based & permission-based access
- Unit testing with Jest/Mocha, snapshot testing
- Middleware chaining, Dependency Injection, caching strategies
- Profiling Node.js apps

### Exercises:
